# TODO: add shell utilities for simple local images processing such as:
# resizing with file max size,
# resizing with image max shape,
# converting to another format,
# blurring a section,
# adding a watermark,
# crop documents pages and save
# crop markers and save
# Maybe have a common util file for bulk ops and then create one file for each of the above util.
